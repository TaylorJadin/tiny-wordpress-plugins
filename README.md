# tiny-wordpress-plugins
This is a convenient place for me to keep track of single purpose snippets of php that I use on wordpress sites. Zip whichever one you want to use up (should be named like `remove-admin-stuff.zip`) and upload it on the `/wp-admin/plugins.php` page to install, or just drop the bare `.php` file in `wp-content/plugins`
